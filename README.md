# Setup
1. Install the following Python packages: Telethon (https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/), Dotenv (https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
2. Log into Telegram Core (my.telegram.org), create an application (if an application has not already been created), and obtain a API ID and API Key for your Telegram account from the application configuration page (https://my.telegram.org/apps).
3. In the .env file, replace the values for "api_id" and "api_key" with the API ID and API Key obtained.
4. Run main.py and enter your Telegram account details as prompted. (You will need to do this at least once, and write access to the folder in which main.py is stored.)
